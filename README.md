# Information System for Elementary School Library SDN 173657 Sihiong

## General Discription
The background for creating this website is the manual book borrowing data management system in the library of SD N 173657 Sihiong, Kec Bonatua Lunasi, located in the Toba Samosir Regency, North Sumatra Province. Currently, the data is recorded on paper, and there is no integration among the stored data. This manual system complicates data analysis during the report generation process and the provision of information. The system to be developed is a web-based Library Information System. Its purpose is to simplify the book borrowing data collection, report generation, and submission approval processes by the school head. Several functions will be incorporated into this system, including the Login Function, Book Borrowing Reports, Library Visitor Reports, report generation, and a submission menu, allowing the school head to approve requests made by library staff through this system. The users of this system we are building are the SD N 173657 Sihiong community. The system will have different roles, namely School Head, User, and Admin, each with specific functions:

- School Head: Can view all activities within the system, such as seeing which students are using the library and which books they borrow, and can approve requests from library staff.
- User: Can borrow books and view the available books in the library through the system.
- Admin: Can view the log of library visitor activities, the books they borrow, generate periodic reports, and submit requests for the addition of books to the school head.
